This directory contains **Claude Code Skills** for this project.

Each skill lives in:

`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

The `name` in the YAML frontmatter becomes a `/slash-command`.

For details, see Claude Code docs:

This project’s skills are designed to operationalize the First Principles Framework (FPF)
and to keep work auditable: hypotheses → predictions → evidence → decisions.
