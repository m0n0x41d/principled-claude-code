## 1) Selection rule

State the explicit policy for selecting problems into the active portfolio **before** applying it.

- **Policy:** (e.g., "highest impact with stepping-stone potential", "most measurable first", "diversify across domains")
- **Capacity:** (how many active problems can be worked simultaneously)
- **Review cadence:** (when to re-evaluate the portfolio — per session, weekly, per milestone)

> The selection rule must be stated before selection, not rationalized after.
> Ad-hoc prioritization is not a portfolio — it's drift.

## 2) Archive (all known problems)

| # | Problem ID | Title | Source | Domain | Status | Stepping-stone? | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | PROB-… / ANOM-… | … | … | … | Open / Resolved / Deferred | Yes / No | … |
| 2 | … | … | … | … | … | … | … |

> Include resolved and deferred problems. The archive is the full inventory.

## 3) Active portfolio

Problems selected for current work cycle, according to the selection rule above.

| Priority | Problem ID | Title | Why selected (per policy) | Assigned | Target |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | … | … | … | … | … |
| 2 | … | … | … | … | … |
| 3 | … | … | … | … | … |

## 4) Diversification check

- **Domain coverage:** (are we only working on one domain? is that intentional?)
- **Explore / exploit balance:** (how many problems are exploratory vs exploitation of known approaches?)
- **Stepping-stone coverage:** (are any active problems stepping stones for deferred ones?)
- **Risk concentration:** (are all active problems high-risk? all low-risk? balanced?)

> A healthy portfolio has a mix: some safe bets, some exploratory, some that unlock future work.
