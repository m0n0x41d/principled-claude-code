## 1) Setup

- Preconditions:
- Data / fixtures:
- Configuration:

---

## 2) Procedure (run-time)

Exact commands / steps to reproduce:

```bash
# commands here
```

---

## 3) Raw outputs

Paste key outputs (or link to log files).

---

## 4) Interpretation (conservative)

- What does this evidence support?
- What does it *not* support?
- Confounders / alternative explanations:

---

## 5) Assurance update (optional but recommended)

- **F (Formality):** informal | structured | formalizable | proof-grade
- **G (Claim scope):** where this applies (conditions / boundaries)
- **R (Reliability):** 0–1 estimate, conservative

If this evidence is part of a dependency chain, remember: overall reliability is bounded by the weakest link.

## 6) Follow-ups

- Next tests:
- Refutations to pursue:
- Refresh plan (if evidence decays):
